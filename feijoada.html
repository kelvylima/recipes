    <p>A version of feijoada from Northeastern Brazil. Feijoada is a dish made throughout Brazil, and there are many versions, but this recipe is the most common 'day-to-day' version you'll encounter in backyard barbeques and birthday parties in the Northeast.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>½ (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained</li>

        <li> onion, diced</li>

        <li>¼ pound smoked ham, diced</li>

        <li>¼ pound calabresa (Portuguese smoked sausage), cut into 1/4-inch slices</li>

        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced, divided</li>

        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>

        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>

        <li>1 bay leaf</li>

        <li>1 ½ teaspoons olive oil</li>

        <li>4 leaves collard greens, cut into fine ribbons, or to taste</li>

        <li>1 ½ cups cassava flour</li>

        <li>1 ½ teaspoons butter, or to taste</li>

        <li>4 cups cooked white rice</li>

        <li>4 oranges, cut in wedges, or as desired</li>

        <li>¼ cup coarsely chopped cilantro</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Combine beans, onion, ham, calabresa, 3 cloves garlic, salt, cumin, black pepper, and bay leaf in a pressure cooker; cover with water to fill line.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Close cooker securely and place pressure regulator over vent according to manufacturer's instructions. Cook at high pressure until regulator is gently rocking, 5 to 7 minutes. Reduce pressure to low. Cook, adding water halfway if needed, until beans are tender and water is reduced to your liking, about 1 hour.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Turn off heat. Let pressure release naturally according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock lid and remove. Let feijoada cool until ready to serve.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Saute remaining 1 clove garlic and collard greens until just tender, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Place cassava flour in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir until toasted, about 3 minutes. Stir in butter.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Serve feijoada with the collards-garlic mixture, toasted cassava flour, rice, orange wedges, and cilantro.</li>

    </ol>
